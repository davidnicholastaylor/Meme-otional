## *Life is often a blur.*

#### When explaining your wellness to a professional, most people default to saying, “I’m fine.”

#### This app allows the user to track their ups and down.
 
#### With a simple but fun format, the user can better articulate their well-being to professionals or simply track their wellness for personal reflection.

#### The ultimate goal is providing self-awareness that leads to better support and self-accountability.
