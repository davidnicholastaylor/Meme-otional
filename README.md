## *Life is often a blur.* :dizzy_face:

<p> When explaining your wellness to a professional, most people default to saying, “I’m fine.”</p>

<p> This app allows the user to track their ups and down.</p>
 
<p> With a simple but fun format, the user can better articulate their well-being to professionals or simply track their wellness for personal reflection.</p>

<p> The ultimate goal is providing self-awareness that leads to better support and self-accountability.</p>
